# FraudDetection
Fraud detection using machine learning and deep learning techniques on a card-not-present dataset


The dataset used in this work is IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection, which was made available on Kaggle as a beginning point for use in a competition to design a transaction fraud detection model by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) in association with the Vesta company. This dataset includes data on online card-not-present transactions, or transactions that take place over the internet. 

It is divided into two files. Train transaction files contain 394 transaction features, and train identity files have 41 identification features. Based on the transactions' ID, the identification and transaction datasets can be merged to produce a dataset of 590540 transaction records with 434 attributes.

A great many values in the combined dataset are missing. As a result, the majority of the columns in this study have been eliminated based on the number of missing data and domain knowledge. Different methods, such imputation and placements, are used to fill in the remaining missing data. Following simple preprocessing, 48 attributes and 590540 records left in the dataset. The pre-processing steps that were done are described in the files.
